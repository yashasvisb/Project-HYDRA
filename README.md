# Project-HYDRA
Prototype for atmospheric water recovery using climate data

💧 Project HYDRA – Prototype

Project HYDRA is a concept-validation prototype for atmospheric water harvesting that leverages the high moisture-adsorption capacity of MOF-303 and utilizes waste heat for energy-efficient water release.

The system captures water vapor from ambient air through adsorption, followed by controlled desorption using low-grade waste heat. The released moisture is then condensed and collected as usable water. The prototype focuses on demonstrating the feasibility, efficiency, and scalability of this adsorption–desorption approach under low-humidity and off-grid conditions.

This repository presents the technical architecture, workflow simulation, and system logic of the prototype, serving as a foundation for future automation, sensor integration, and real-world deployment.
